This site is the central platform for the documentation of the Rockefeller Archive Center. It enables the discovery of our institutional policies, workflows, manuals, and other content related to RAC operations. The documentation is hosted in repositories on our [RAC GitHub](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter), and this site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based templates that style, structure, and deploy the site (available in the [docs-theme](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-theme) GitHub repository).
